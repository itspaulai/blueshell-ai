When Chrome shows “Review the app name change” with an old name (“WebLLM Chat”) instead of the latest name (“Blueshell”), it’s usually because Chrome has cached an older PWA configuration and notices the manifest has been updated. Chrome is essentially alerting the user that the installed PWA’s name changed.

Below are some things you can check or do to ensure Chrome picks up “Blueshell” correctly and doesn’t show the old name:

---

## 1) Confirm the Manifest is Linked Correctly

1. **In your HTML head**, ensure you have something like:
   ```html
   <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">
   ```
   and that it points **directly** to the updated manifest file (the one containing `"name": "Blueshell", "short_name": "Blueshell"`).

2. Make sure you only have **one** manifest link in your HTML. If there’s a hidden or leftover `<link rel="manifest" href="...">` pointing to a different file, Chrome might pick up conflicting info.

3. **Check “scope”** (optional, but recommended). Sometimes adding `"scope": "/"` (or the appropriate path) to your `manifest.json` helps ensure everything is recognized under the correct path:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Blueshell",
     "short_name": "Blueshell",
     "scope": "/",
     ...
   }
   ```

## 2) Ensure Service Worker and Manifest Are in Sync

The service worker code you shared looks fine. However, be sure your service worker is actually **caching the correct `manifest.json`** (and not a stale version) by confirming the URL in `urlsToCache`:

```js
const urlsToCache = [
  '/',
  '/index.html',
  '/manifest.json',  // Make sure it's exactly the right path
  ...
];
```

---

## 3) Clear Old Service Workers and Caches

Because PWAs are heavily reliant on caches and offline storage, you may need to clear old cached data so the browser pulls the latest manifest. 

In Chrome:
1. Open DevTools (right-click, Inspect).
2. Go to **Application** tab (or **Storage** in some versions).
3. Under **Service Workers**, click **Unregister** for your site’s service worker.
4. Under **Storage** → **Clear storage**, check everything and **Clear site data**.
5. Revisit the site (online) to let the new service worker and manifest install fresh.

## 4) Consider Uninstalling/Reinstalling the PWA

If the PWA was already installed as “WebLLM Chat”, Chrome may keep that name until it updates. By design, Chrome prompts the user to confirm app name changes rather than silently doing it. Sometimes, the easiest way to ensure the new name is recognized is:

1. **Uninstall** the old version of the PWA (right-click on the PWA shortcut, or go to Chrome Apps, or from the OS, and uninstall/remove).
2. Go to your website again and install it fresh (“Add to Home Screen” / “Install App”).

Afterward, it should consistently show as **Blueshell**.

## 5) Let Chrome’s Prompt Run Its Course

If you do keep the PWA installed and simply update the manifest from one name to another, Chrome is *supposed* to show a “Review the app name change” prompt. This is a user-facing safeguard. In many cases, if the user accepts or dismisses that prompt, Chrome will remember the newly updated name thereafter.

### Summary

- Make sure your manifest is referenced correctly and has consistent `"name"`/`"short_name"`.
- Clear out old caches and service workers to avoid stale data.
- If it’s still an issue, fully uninstall the previous PWA and install the new one.

Once all caches are cleared and the user either reinstalls or agrees to the name change, Chrome should display “Blueshell” going forward.
